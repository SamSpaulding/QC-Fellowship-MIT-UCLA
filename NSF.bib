As such, increasing children’s skills early on could improve their success in middle and high school. To this end, we propose that a robotic learning companion could supplement children’s early language education. The robot targets both the social nature of language learning and the adaptation necessary to help individual children. The robot is designed as a social character that interacts with children as a peer, not as a tutor or teacher. It will play a storytelling game, during which it will introduce new vocabulary words, and model good story narration skills, such as including a beginning, middle, and end; varying sentence structure; and keeping cohesion across the story. We will evaluate whether adapting the robot’s level of language to the child’s - so that, as children improve their storytelling skills, so does the robot - influences (i) whether children learn new words from the robot, (ii) the complexity and style of stories children tell, (iii) the similarity of children’s stories to the robot’s stories. We expect children will learn more from a robot that adapts to maintain an equal or greater ability than the children, and that they will copy its stories and narration style more than they would with a robot that does not adapt (a robot of lesser ability). However, we also expect that playing with a robot of lesser ability could prompt teaching or mentoring behavior from children, which could also be beneficial to language learning.}, booktitle={2014 RO-MAN: The 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication}, author={Kory, Jacqueline and Breazeal, Cynthia}, year={2014}, pages={643–648}, url={http://robotic.media.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2015/01/KoryBreazeal-ROMAN-14.pdf}}

Such systems track and assess students’ knowledge via inferential methods, such as the popular Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) algorithm. However, these methods do not typically draw on the affective signals that human teachers use to assess knowledge, such as indications of discomfort, engagement, or frustration. In this paper we present a novel extension to the BKT model that uses affective data, derived autonomously from video records of children playing an interactive story-telling game with a robot, to infer student knowledge of reading skills. We find that, compared to a control group of children who played the game with only a tablet, children who interacted with an embodied social robot generated stronger affective data signals of engagement and enjoyment during the interaction. We then show that incorporating this affective data into model training improves the quality of the learned knowledge inference models. These results suggest that physically embodied, affect-aware robot tutors can provide more effective and empathic educational experiences for children, and advance both algorithmic and human-centered motivations for further development of systems that tightly integrate affect understanding and complex models of inference with interactive, educational robots.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Autonomous Agents & Multiagent Systems}, publisher={International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems}, author={Spaulding, Samuel and Gordon, Goren and Breazeal, Cynthia}, year={2016}, pages={864–872}, collection={AAMAS ’16}}

Books present static images and text on the page, whereas toys allow for manipulation and interactive exploration of cause-effect relations. What if books were “tinkerable”? What if children could actively explore and modify a story, through voice and touch, to dynamically explore meaning as conveyed by the relationship of text to illustrated concept? How might this change how books are experienced, explored, and shared between parent and child? How might interactivity support and enhance existing shared reading practices? We report the development of interaction design techniques for encouraging storytelling behavior during shared book reading. The design of our storytelling platform, the TinkRBook, encourages active exploration when parents read to very young children (ages 2--5 years old). Our approach uses findings from in-situ parent-child ethnographies and advice from 24 participatory design interviews with researchers, designers and professionals from relevant domains. We believe that our approach addresses the environmental conditions in which interactive storytelling with preschoolers is most likely to be adopted, and is compatible with current shared reading practices.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Interaction Design and Children}, publisher={ACM}, author={Chang, Angela and Breazeal, Cynthia}, year={2011}, pages={145–148}, collection={IDC ’11}}
